This file acts as the command‑line utility for administrative tasks.
It provides a minimal stub for Django's `manage.py`. Since the
full Django package may not be available in this environment,
this script illustrates the typical entry point without executing
framework‑specific code. When run in a proper Django environment,
it will delegate commands to `django.core.management`.
